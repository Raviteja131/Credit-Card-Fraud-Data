# Credit-Card-Fraud-Data

This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using a credit card dataset by building models like logistic regression, decision trees, and gradient boosting machines (GBM). It involves data preprocessing, model evaluation, and tuning to identify the best predictive model, which can be scaled and applied in real-world fraud detection systems.
